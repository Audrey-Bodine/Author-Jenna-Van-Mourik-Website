The Messiah changed her life, but now her life is in danger. Antioch’s Daughter, book two in the Generations of Faith series,
follows Libi and her family as they are scattered across the ancient world after the stoning of Stephen and persecution of believers in Jerusalem.
Years later, loss, betrayal, love, and interactions with the mysterious newcomer called Cassius test her faith. Saul, a persecutor from her past, re-emerges in Antioch just as she is starting to feel comfortable,
forcing Libi to confront doubts she didn’t know she carried. How far does grace go, and will she have the strength to find out?
